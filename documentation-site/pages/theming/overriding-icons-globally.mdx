# Overriding icons globally

Sometimes you need to override the icons used by the components, like the arrows in the pagination component.

To do that, please use the `IconProvider` component, and wrap the root of your application with it.

<Example
  title="IconProvider example"
  path="examples/icon-provider/example.js"
>
  <IconProvider />
</Example>
